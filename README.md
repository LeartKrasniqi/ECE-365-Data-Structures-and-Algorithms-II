# ECE-365-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-II
Continuation of DSA1 with Prof. Sable:

Assignment 1: This program implements a hash table to create a spell-checking program.  A dictionary is loaded into the hash table and it is used to check an input file provided by the user. 

Assignment 2: This program allows a user to manipulate a binary heap, which is dependent on the previously implemented hash table. 

Assignment 3: This program prompts a user to insert a text file laying out a set of vertices, edges, and weights associated with the edges.  The program then implements Dijktra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a user-specified first vertex to all the other vertices in the graph.
