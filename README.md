Continuation of DSA1 with Prof. Sable:

Assignment 1: This program implements a hash table to create a spell-checking program.  A dictionary is loaded into the hash table and it is used to check an input file provided by the user. 

Assignment 2: This program allows a user to manipulate a binary heap, which is dependent on the previously implemented hash table. 

Assignment 3: This program prompts a user to insert a text file laying out a set of vertices, edges, and weights associated with the edges.  The program then implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a user-specified first vertex to all the other vertices in the graph.

Assignment 4: This program implements dynamic programming to solve a problem from the 1998 regional ACM programming contest.  A file with blocks of three strings is loaded and the program checks to see if the third string is a valid merge of the first two.
